# 🕶️ ShadowFox v2  
**Adaptive Reconnaissance & Offensive AI Framework**

---

## ❝Those who control the shadows, control the outcome.❞

ShadowFox is not your usual security tool.  
This is **Phase Two** of a long-range operation.  
A modular AI-assisted system designed for the battlefield of the web.

⚠️ It's not complete.  
⚠️ It's not safe for amateurs.  
⚠️ But it's already alive.

What is NOT here:
- MutationCore AI
- GhostThreads AI
- ProofSeed Logic
- Active bypass modules
- Our internal PDF analysis/agent system

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts a target
- Begins modular initialization
- Launches fuzzing sequences
- Uses AI heuristics for decision-making *(to be expanded)*

## 👁 Future Vision

ShadowFox is designed to:
- Learn with each mission
- Develop new payloads dynamically
- Operate without human intervention
- Leave no trace unless we want it

This is just the beginning.
